BACK IN THE PARKS

<p>Me and&nbsp;the&nbsp;lady went to the park. The big one in NYC, not sure what it's called. The romance was out of control. We walked around and took pictures.&nbsp;</p>

Bikes by the Beach

<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to experience Atlantic City&rsquo;s iconic <a href="http://atlanticcitynj.com/visitors/thingstodo/attractions/boardwalk.aspx">Boardwalk</a>? Walking allows you to take it all in, but walking the whole four-mile boardwalk &ndash; and the return trip &ndash; could eat up a whole day. The rolling chairs are fun and comfortable but may be a little pricey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Biking is the best of both worlds. Even a leisurely ride up and down the boardwalk can be done in less than two hours (even with the inevitable shopping and dining stops), and Atlantic City Boardwalk <a href="http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/explore/sports-outdoors/details.aspx?id=27231">bicycle rental rates</a> are very reasonable at $8 for the first hour and $1 for every additional 15 minutes thereafter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to catch your attention along the Great Wooden Way. Shoppers can browse and buy anything from trinkets in small souvenir shops to Louis Vuitton purses at the high-end <a href="http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/explore/shopping/pier-shops-caesars/">Pier Shops at Caesars</a>. If pedaling builds your appetite, you can savor some authentic saltwater taffy or feast on a gourmet breakfast on or right near the Boardwalk. Thirsty riders can also lock up their bikes and check out the Boardwalk&rsquo;s coffee shops and caf&eacute;s.</p>
<p>For a more passive form of entertainment, you can always park the bikes and sit back for some lovely sea views and some of the world&rsquo;s best people-watching.</p>
<p>A Boardwalk bicycle adventure is one of the best ways to experience what makes the Boardwalk so great &ndash; sea breezes, leisurely atmosphere and great shopping, dining and entertainment. Book your <a href="http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/explore/sports-outdoors/biking-running/" target="_blank">Atlantic City bike rental</a>today and get ready to saddle up!</p>

Bikes, sand, people, more bikes

Announcement: I'm now a Doctor Woohoo!

<p>I, part-time creator of Js Date, have just earned my doctor degree. I'm all about surgery and caring for people. I want to thank everyone including my girlfriend&nbsp;who is a real life princess of Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a physician employee, many times for many hospitals and clinics. I&rsquo;d stay a year or two, but eventually I&rsquo;d quit. Then, in 2005, I opened an ideal clinic designed by my patients. Ten years later, I still love private practice. Why? I&rsquo;m finally practicing medicine the way I had always imagined.</p>
<p>When I decided to open a private practice, I was determined to do things differently. I needed to know what my patients really wanted from me. So I led a series of town hall meetings where I invited my community to design an ideal medical clinic. I collected 100 pages of written testimony, adopted 90 percent of the feedback, and opened one month later. Now my job description is written by patients, not administrators. I&rsquo;m finally the doctor my patients had always imagined.</p>

Coding or Love

<p>There is power in understanding the journey of others to help create your own. I have always drawn on my muses for inspiration. During my formative years living abroad in Italy, I&rsquo;d devour the VHS tapes of C#&nbsp;stars of the &rsquo;80s that my grandfather would send across the Atlantic. Later on, when I moved back to America and was the kid in school who dressed differently and had trouble reading and writing in English, Coding&nbsp;was my outlet, my source of power.</p>
<p>Coding&nbsp;is the vehicle through which I question myself. It&rsquo;s the vehicle in which I learn about myself.</p>
<p>Now, after 18 years in the CodingBA, I want to show you the journey. The pain, the sacrifice, the disappointments and the glory. I want to show you what it really means to chase greatness.</p>

The other day I made a big life decision.
